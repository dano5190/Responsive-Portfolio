      <p>My name is Daniel O'Connell.  I am a student in the University of Washington's Coding BootCamp.  Coding HTML and CSS are fairly new for me,
          but coding in general is not new for me.  Before I took this, I had some experience learning other coding languages.  The two other coding languages
          I learned were Java and C++.  They were hard to learn, but it was also fun too.</p>
          <p>
          Besides coding, I also enjoy video games and rock climbing.  I am a hard worker and I like working in groups or alone.  It is my hope to 
          Get a job in the coding field, whether it be with web development or with software programming.  An information technology job sounds good too.
